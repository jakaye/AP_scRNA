# AP_scRNA
Data and code for processing single nuclei transcriptomes from the study "Area Postrema Cell Types that Mediate Nausea-associated Behaviors"

In this repository are the counts matricies provided by zUMIs 2.8.0 of single nuclei encapsulated by InDrop. Also provided is an R markdown file detailing the processing conducted to achieve the published data. The markdown file was also knit into a html file for a reader's convenience. A csv file containing metadata for nuclei that pass QC, with designation for Cell Type, AP or NTS, AP neuronal subtype, and corresponding UMAP embeddings. The final seurat object for the neurons of the AP is also provided here.
